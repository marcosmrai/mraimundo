This research project is a framework using a posteriori multiobjective optimization to train generalized linear models. To deal with the multiple models resultant from the training I explored ensemble filtering and aggregation technique. One of the strengths of this framework resides in its flexibility, being applicable to multi-class and multi-label classification, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and multi-view learning.
