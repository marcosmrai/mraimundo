abstract = "This work proposes a novel multi-objective optimization approach that globally finds a representative non-inferior set of solutions, also known as Pareto-optimal solutions, by automatically formulating and solving a sequence of weighted sum method scalarization problems. The approach is called MONISE (Many-Objective NISE) because it represents an extension of the well-known non-inferior set estimation (NISE) algorithm, which was originally conceived to deal with two-dimensional objective spaces. The proposal is endowed with the following characteristics: (1) uses a mixed-integer linear programming formulation to operate in two or more dimensions, thus properly supporting many (i.e., three or more) objectives; (2) relies on an external algorithm to solve the weighted sum method scalarization problem to optimality; and (3) creates a faithful representation of the Pareto frontier in the case of convex problems, and a useful approximation of it in the non-convex case. Moreover, when dealing specifically with two objectives, some additional properties are portrayed for the estimated non-inferior set. Experimental results validate the proposal and indicate that MONISE is competitive, in convex and non-convex (combinatorial) problems, both in terms of computational cost and the overall quality of the non-inferior set, measured by the acquired hypervolume."
