abstract = "This paper proposes multiobjective-based classifiers to detect epileptic seizures using ensemble approaches, transfer-learning methods, and three alternative feature extraction techniques. Two aspects of the problem were investigated: (1) the relative merit of distinct proposals to synthesize an ensemble of classifiers, considering all the three feature extraction techniques; (2) the potential of an ensemble composed of transfer-learned classifiers. The blend approaches with the best performance detected all test seizures, with a high proportion of correctly detected samples inside the seizure interval and high proportion of time intervals correctly classified as non-seizures."
