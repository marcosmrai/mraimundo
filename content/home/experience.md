  - title: Postdoctoral Researcher
    company: School of Applied Mathematics - FGV

    description: I developed a project analysing criminality in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro using Machine Learning, Visualization and Optimization tools. I created a interpretability tool for machine learning that creates counterfactual scenarios (when you change the variables to change the prediction of a learning machine) that reduces criminalities on regions of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, this tool was created using combinatorial optimization and machine learning. To deal with multiple counterfactual antecedents for multiple regions we created a visualization tool that helped finding counterfactual scenarios for multiple, similar, regions and also to understand which counterfactual scenarios are more promising in reality.
