**Goals:**

* Spark interest in the application of linear algebra to machine learning.
* Introduce fundamental concepts like systems of linear equations, matrices, vector spaces, and linear independence.
* Connect these concepts to a real-world machine learning algorithm â€“ Linear Regression.

**Lesson Plan:**

1. **Motivation:**
   - Briefly discuss the importance of machine learning and its reliance on linear algebra.
   - Highlight that even simple algorithms like linear regression use linear algebra concepts.

2. **Linear Regression:**
   - Introduce the concept of finding the best linear relationship between variables.
   - Use a simple example to illustrate the goal.
   - Visualize the problem using a scatter plot and demonstrate fitting a line to the data.

3. **Systems of Linear Equations:**
   - Show how the linear regression problem can be formulated as a system of linear equations.
   - Explain the concept of a solution and briefly touch upon solving methods.

4. **Introduction to Matrices:**
   - Introduce matrices as a concise way to represent systems of linear equations.
   - Explain basic terminology and show basic matrix operations.

5. **Vector Spaces:**
   - Explain that data points and model predictions can be thought of as vectors.
   - Briefly introduce the concept of a vector space.

6. **Linear Independence:**
   - Explain the concept of linear independence and its significance in machine learning.
   - Use a simple example to illustrate linear independence and dependence.

7. **Wrap-up and Preview:**
   - Summarize key concepts and mention how they will be further developed.
   - Encourage students to explore recommended resources.
