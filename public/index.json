It consists of generating synthetic samples from an original sample to achieve the desired outcome in a machine learning model thus helping to understand the prediction. An insightful methodology would explore a broader set of counterfactual antecedents to reveal multiple possibilities while operating on any classifier. Thus, we create a treebased search that requires monotonicity from the objective functions (aka cost functions); it allows pruning branches that will not improve the objective functions. Since monotonicity is only required for the objective function, this method can be used for any family of classifiers (eg, linear models, neural networks, decision trees). However, additional classifier properties speed up the tree-search when it foresees branches that will not result in feasible actions. Moreover, the proposed optimization generates a diverse set of Pareto-optimal counterfactual antecedents by relying on multi-objective concepts. The results show an algorithm with working guarantees that enumerates a wide range of counterfactual antecedents.

The problem's hardness is linked to the sparse nature of the crime activity and its spread in large spatial areas. Sparseness hampers most time series comparison methods from working properly, while handling large areas tends to render the computational costs of such methods impractical. Visualizing different patterns hidden on crime time series data is another issue, mainly due to the patterns that can show up from the time series analysis. In this paper, we present a new methodology that comprises two main components designed to handle the spatial sparsity and spreading of crimes in large areas. The first component relies on a stochastic mechanism to visually analyze probableXintensive crime hotspots. Such analysis reveals important patterns that can not be observed in the typical hotspot visualization. The second component builds upon a deep-learning mechanism to embed crime time series in a Cartesian-space. From the embedding, one can identify spatial locations where the crime time series have similar behavior. The two components have been integrated into a web-based analytical tool called CriPAV, enabling a global and street-level view of crime patterns. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, CriPAV has been validated through a set of case studies with real crime data. The provided experiments reveal the effectiveness of CriPAV in identifying patterns such as locations where crimes are not intense but highly probable to occur and locations that are far apart from each other but bear similar crime patterns.","tags":null,"title":"CriPAV: Street-Level Crime Patterns Analysis and Visualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos M Raimundo","Thalita F Drumond","Alan Caio R Marques","Christiano Lyra","Anderson Rocha","Fernando J Von Zuben"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620345600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620345600,"objectID":"a89ef2a236d11568c62915b7863d494e","permalink":"ic.unicamp.br/marcos/publication/2020_neurocomputing/2020_neurocomputing/","publishdate":"2021-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_neurocomputing/2020_neurocomputing/","section":"publication","summary":"Multinomial logistic loss and l2 regularization are often conflicting objectives as more robust regularization leads to restrained multinomial parameters. For many practical problems, leveraging the best of both worlds would be invaluable for better decision-making processes. This research proposes a novel framework to obtain representative and diverse l2-regularized multinomial models, based on valuable trade-offs between prediction error and model complexity. The framework relies upon the Non-Inferior Set Estimation (NISE) method – a deterministic multiobjective solver. NISE automatically implements hyperparameter tuning in a multiobjective context. Given the diverse set of efficient learning models, model selection and aggregation of the multiple models in an ensemble framework promote high performance in multiclass classification. Additionally, NISE uses the weighted sum method as scalarization, thus being able to deal with the learning formulation directly. Its deterministic nature and the convexity of the learning problem confer scalability to the proposal. The experiments show competitive performance in various setups, taking a broad set of multiclass classification methods as contenders.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring multiobjective training in multiclass classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos M.

The approach is called MONISE (Many-Objective NISE) because it represents an extension of the well-known non-inferior set estimation (NISE) algorithm, which was originally conceived to deal with two-dimensional objective spaces. The proposal is endowed with the following characteristics: (1) uses a mixed-integer linear programming formulation to operate in two or more dimensions, thus properly supporting many (i.e., three or more) objectives; (2) relies on an external algorithm to solve the weighted sum method scalarization problem to optimality; and (3) creates a faithful representation of the Pareto frontier in the case of convex problems, and a useful approximation of it in the non-convex case. Moreover, when dealing specifically with two objectives, some additional properties are portrayed for the estimated non-inferior set. Experimental results validate the proposal and indicate that MONISE is competitive, in convex and non-convex (combinatorial) problems, both in terms of computational cost and the overall quality of the non-inferior set, measured by the acquired hypervolume.","tags":null,"title":"An extension of the non-inferior set estimation algorithm for many objectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos M Raimundo","Fernando J Von Zuben"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"f3c64eb122d9ec12289467d433a8fa17","permalink":"ic.unicamp.br/marcos/publication/2020_ijcnn/2020_ijcnn/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_ijcnn/2020_ijcnn/","section":"publication","summary":"On binary classification, the goal of minimizing the false positive and false negative rates creates a conflict, being impossible to optimize both simultaneously. This challenge is even more significant on imbalanced classification datasets since an incorrect choice of the relative relevance of each objective on the optimization can lead to ignoring, or poorly learning the minority class. The proposal of this work takes into account the existing conflict among the learning losses of the classes, and use a deterministic multi-objective optimization method, called MONISE, to create a set of solutions with diverse misclassification tradeoffs among the classes. Since accuracy is no longer a proper criterion for imbalanced datasets, we had to resort to multiple criteria to report the performance: each classifier, proposed or competitors, was selected and reported using the same metrics. We used F1 , kappa and g-mean for general evaluation of performance and Fβs (F1/16 , F1/4 , F4 and F16 ) to emulate a shifting decision maker preference from precision to recall; all comparisons were made using a Friedman test with Finner posthoc test. However, when we take into account multiple metrics without any prior knowledge, it may become impossible to pinpoint the best method, since the evaluation criteria may also be in conflict. Again, to solve this, we resorted to a Friedman test with a non-dominated ranking. With this multi-criteria analyses, we conclude that explicitly considering multiple objectives on the optimization can guide to promising results.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-criteria analysis involving Pareto-optimal misclassification tradeoffs on imbalanced datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"b3f8d49b7e841ae02e4e86ec6914d073","permalink":"ic.unicamp.br/marcos/project/ethicalai/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ethicalai/","section":"project","summary":"The goal of this project is to promote trust, transparency and fairness in machine learning models.","tags":["Machine Learning","Fairness","Interpretability","Privacy","Transparence","Social Good"],"title":"Ethical AI","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

Machine learning tools, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are then welcome to automatically generate high-performance classifiers from available data. Supported by the image datasets available at the largest online database on ant biology, the AntWeb (www.antweb.org), we propose here an ensemble of CNNs to identify ant genera directly from the head, profile and dorsal perspectives of ant images. Transfer learning is also considered to improve the individual performance of the CNN classifiers. The performance achieved by the classifiers is diverse enough to promote a reduction in the overall classification error when they are combined in an ensemble, achieving an accuracy rate of over 80% on top-1 classification and an accuracy of over 90% on top-3 classification.","tags":null,"title":"Ant genera identification using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando S.

By balancing or not the relevance of each label, two versions were conceived for the proposal. The balanced one presented a good performance for recall and F1 metrics, and the unbalanced one for 1-Hamming loss and precision metrics.","tags":null,"title":"Many-Objective Ensemble-Based Multilabel Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando S.

The approach is called MONISE (Many-Objective NISE), because it represents an extension of the well-known non-inferior set estimation (NISE) algorithm, which was originally conceived to deal with two-dimensional objective spaces. Looking for theoretical support, we demonstrate that being a solution of the weighted problem is a necessary condition, and it will also be a sufficient condition at the convex hull of the feasible set. The proposal is conceived to operate in more than two dimensions, thus properly supporting many objectives. Moreover, specifically deal with two objectives, some nice additional properties are portrayed for the estimated non-inferior set. Experimental results are used to validate the proposal and have indicated that MONISE is competitive both in terms of computational cost and considering the overall quality of the non-inferior set, measured by the hypervolume.","tags":null,"title":"MONISE - Many Objective Non-Inferior Set Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Machine learning problems commonly have to deal with implicit or explicit conflicting objectives, thus leading to trade-offs. One of the most traditional is the model complexity vs. error rate on training trade-off. However, more complex is the model, more capable to adapt to data, thus reducing error; and vice-versa. But there are many other conflicting goals such as: error rate on each class; error rate vs. interpretability; error rate vs. fairness metrics.\nPrevious research investigated the impact of optimization methods in machine learning, finding interesting impacts of multi-objective optimization in model selection, ensemble diversity, and knowledge sharing for classification problems, and esulted in applications in biology, medicine, logistics, and power transmissions; and also have theoretical contributions to machine learning, operations research, and multi-objective optimization.\nThis project has three main goals: 1) Create a software framework to ease modeling and running conflicting objectives in machine learning; 2) Investigate theoretical consequences of modeling machine learning problems as multi-objective ones; 3) Creation of models to be employed in a wide sprectrum of applications. As a result, we expect to create a helpful framework that would machine learning experts to model tasks with conflicting objectives.\n","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1398902400,"objectID":"56781fc082dcb9de2f583dfbf2973076","permalink":"ic.unicamp.br/marcos/project/mol/","publishdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mol/","section":"project","summary":"Multiobjective optimization in machine learning","tags":["Multi-Objective Learning","Machine Learning","Multi-objective Optimization"],"title":"Multiobjective optimization in machine learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Many practical applications are better modeled as optimization problem, characterized by the existence of multiple conflicting objectives.
