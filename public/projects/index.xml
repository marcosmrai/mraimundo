      <title>Multiobjective optimization in machine learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning problems commonly have to deal with implicit or explicit conflicting objectives, thus leading to trade-offs. One of the most traditional is the model complexity vs. error rate on training trade-off. However, more complex is the model, more capable to adapt to data, thus reducing error; and vice-versa. But there are many other conflicting goals such as: error rate on each class; error rate vs. interpretability; error rate vs. fairness metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research investigated the impact of optimization methods in machine learning, finding interesting impacts of multi-objective optimization in model selection, ensemble diversity, and knowledge sharing for classification problems, and esulted in applications in biology, medicine, logistics, and power transmissions; and also have theoretical contributions to machine learning, operations research, and multi-objective optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has three main goals: 1) Create a software framework to ease modeling and running conflicting objectives in machine learning; 2) Investigate theoretical consequences of modeling machine learning problems as multi-objective ones; 3) Creation of models to be employed in a wide sprectrum of applications. As a result, we expect to create a helpful framework that would machine learning experts to model tasks with conflicting objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Algorithms for Multi-objective Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many practical applications are better modeled as optimization problem, characterized by the existence of multiple conflicting objectives. A classical and usual example is the compromise between maximizing consumer satisfaction and minimizing service cost. Indeed, dealing with conflicting objectives is omnipresent in our lives, and a significant portion of these multi-objective problems admits a proper mathematical formulation, so that we may resort to computational resources to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions, also called non-inferior solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any assumption from the decision maker, all non-inferior solutions are equally relevant, so what we want to research in this project are algorithms capable of find a good representative set of non inferior solutions - those methods are called a posteriori multiobjective methods. This optimization framework can be applied to logistic problems, economics and &lt;a href=&#34;../mol/&#34;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
